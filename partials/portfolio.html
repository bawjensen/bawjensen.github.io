  <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm a recent graduate from Wheaton College (MA) with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Over my college career I learned all the fundamentals of the trade, but I also had fun in my free time working on the things the interested me a little more. At the moment, those interests focus mainly on web development and artificial neural networks. Web development is fun because you can create production-quality products as a solo developer with HTML/CSS/JS, but my real passion is everything that can be done with neural nets. I'm not big on the academic/research side of things, so I may never go get my Masters and dive really deep into ANNs, but I really enjoy messing around with them, seeing how they can be applied, what their strengths (and weaknesses) are, and more. You can see a reflection of these interests in my portfolio below.</p>
