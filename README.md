Github user page as my personal website.

The current state of the page is very much "I want this to be done". When I was designing it, I was working on at least two other projects that I had made up for myself, and this was being neglected, so I decided to put it in a good spot before I forgot about it for a few months.

It's been a few months, and I've yet to return to it. I want to apply what I've learned about web development/design, and I'll probably find an outlet through this page, but it'll be when I have some free time, so god knows when.

NOTE: Everything as a part of this site was (at least so far) made from scratch by referencing other people's work (and of course StackOverflow). I believe it is best, at least for now, to do everything myself in order to better understand what I'm doing and why it might not work.

Update (7/06/14): Made some starts towards adding a blog, using some fancier concepts, at least more fancy than exist so far on my site. Also, I removed the icons, because I don't see them adding that much to the site.

Update (7/29/14): Time flies and it's impossible to get motivated after work. I'm not a fan of commuting.

## Implementation

Created as an HTML/JS/CSS static site with the LESS precompiler. Possibly considering adding JADE into the mix.
Uses Firebase as a database on the front-end.
