  <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm a Software Engineer with the majority of my experience focusing in UI work and relevant technologies. I've worked in web for the greater portion of my career thus far, using frameworks such as Angular and then React. I've dabbled in various supporting technologies as well from Sass, webpack, and various build-related tools all the way to docker, ECS and more backend concepts. I also have experience working in iOS, using fundamentals of the platform as well as patterns such as reactive architecture using RxSwift. Regardless of the technology stack I find myself in, I always make an effort to understand the fundamentals first.</p>
