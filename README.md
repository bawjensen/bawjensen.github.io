Github user page as my personal website.

The current state of the page is very much "I want this to be done". When I was designing it, I was working on at least two other projects that I had made up for myself, and this was being neglected, so I decided to put it in a good spot before I forgot about it for a few months.

It's been a few months, and I've yet to return to it. I want to apply what I've learned about web development/design, and I'll probably find an outlet through this page, but it'll be when I have some free time, so god knows when.

## Implementation

Made into an HTML/JS/CSS static site with LESS and Jade precompilers.
